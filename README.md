4. **API Design**
   - Standardized response formats
   - Comprehensive error handling
   - Efficient serialization
   - Cache implementation

## Future Improvements & Considerations
1. Implement caching strategy for frequently accessed data
2. Add API versioning
3. Enhance test coverage
4. Implement automated backup system
5. Add real-time notification system
6. Implement API documentation using drf-spectacular

The project demonstrates professional Django development practices with a focus on maintainability, security, and scalability. The codebase is structured to accommodate future growth while maintaining performance and reliability.
